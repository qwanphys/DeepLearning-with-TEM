# DeepLearning-with-TEM
Project for FDUROP

## Intro
Firstly I have tried using some states of arts from Deep Learning to solve obstacles in the field of TEM, namely, how to characterize the configeration of a single atom in low dose electron enviroment? We human beings can't identify through our eyes but the smart computer can do this! And that's the key point of my project.

## Method
